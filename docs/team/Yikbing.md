## Project: BudgetFlow:
Budgetflow is a personal finance management application designed to help students efficiently track their income,
expenses, and savings goals. With a simple, command-based interface, Budgetflow allows users to log their transactions,
filter them by category or date, and analyze their financial habits. It is written in Java with 4kLoC.

### Summary of Contributions
* __New Feature:__ Added the ability to delete Expenses:
  * What it does: This feature allows users to delete their expenses by providing a command `delete-expense`. The user 
  then has to enter `delete-expense [DESCRIPTION]`, which will then delete the corresponding entry from the list.
  * Justification: This feature helps users to be able to delete expenses that were wrongly accounted for.

* __New Feature:__ Added the ability to delete Income:
    * What it does: This feature allows users to delete their expenses by providing a command `delete-income`. The user
      then has to enter `delete-income [DESCRIPTION]`, which will then delete the corresponding entry from the list.
    * Justification: This feature helps users to be able to delete income that were wrongly accounted for.

* __New Feature:__ Added the ability to update Income:
  * What it does: This feature allows users to modify previously logged income using the `update-income` command.
  The user can adjust the `amount`, `category`, or `description` of an existing expense.
  * Justification: This feature enhances the flexibility of the application, as users may realize that they made a
  mistake while logging an income or need to update the details of a transaction. It improves the overall user
  experience by providing them with more control over their financial records.
